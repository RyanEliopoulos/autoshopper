This was the initial attempt at creating the recipe manager. The current state used selenium to retieve authorization tokens in place of an actual web server. The UI at this stage was being built out using the python built-in TKinter. The beginnings of this project used a TUI design. Some terminal escape codes and related learnings can be found early in the commit logs. <br>
