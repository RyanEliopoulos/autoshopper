II  Came across an API response for product search term "yellow onion" that included a generic yellow onion
    lacking pricing and other information. All fields (pickup, delivery, etc.) showed as unavailable.

    Also clear that not all items in the grocery stores are available through the API.  There are certainly more
    than Kroger brand 3lb bags of onions...I can see them using the user interface :(.

    Good news: It was the search term "yellow onion" simply being insufficiently close to the actual product
                name "Onions - Yellow - Small".  With that string the API gives the produce options by the pound :).

II Cannot remove items from the customer cart with the API. Evaluate availability of each item before ordering??
    Could just allow substitutions for now and disable them upon first receipt of unacceptable sub.

    Will also need to rely upon Selenium to navigate through order placement once the time comes.  Will put that off
    to focus on building out the recipe inventory system.
